# The project

## Architecture

- Adaption of VIPER

### List view

- List is a UICollectionViewController without architecture helpers
- Uses UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource available from iOS 13
- Universal: Like a TableView on small devices and CollectionView on big screens

### List presenter

- Class without architecture helpers
- It works with a weak reference to view protocol
- Dependence injection: Uses @Inject property wrapper that isn't build safe, so we need test all!

### Use Case
- Uses Combine framework
- It receives a search query from presenter and manage API calls
- API is injected using @Inject too
 
### Mappers
There is different type of mappers
- Init: A view model can be initialized with a domain model
- Class: Mapper. Tested.
- Self extension: Used to get a domain class from API model

### Localization
- Uses SwiftGen pod
- Available in Spanish and English
- API content isn't translated

## Modularization

- TechTest: Main framework with views and presenters
- Core: Framework with business rules
- TestFoundation: Helpers for tests
- Pods: Cocoapods framework

## Tests

There are tests on TechTest and Core frameworks. You can run all using ‚åòU from main project

## Pods

- Before run project, install pods using [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/))

### View
- [SDWebImage](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage): Used to load images from URLs
- [SwiftGen](https://github.com/SwiftGen/SwiftGen): Used to avoid misspeling with images names and translations

### API
- [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire): Used to perform network requests

### Tests
- [Nimble](https://github.com/Quick/Nimble): Used to improve tests readability
- [Shock](https://github.com/justeat/Shock): Used to mock network request
- [SwiftyMocky](https://github.com/MakeAWishFoundation/SwiftyMocky): Used to create mocks from protocols
